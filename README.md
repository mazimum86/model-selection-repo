# Model Selection Repository

This repository contains various tasks where multiple models have been used to train and evaluate specific datasets. The goal is to determine the most effective model for each task based on performance metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant criteria.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific task, such as breast cancer detection, with the following structure:

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing (e.g., `data.csv`).
- **Models**: Includes the different machine learning models applied to the dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Stores the evaluation metrics, such as accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and any other relevant analyses.
- **Best Model**: The model that demonstrated the best performance based on the evaluation metrics.

## Example Task: Breast Cancer Detection

In the breast cancer detection task, multiple models were trained using the `data.csv` dataset. The models included logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine, among others. After evaluating each model's performance, the model with the highest accuracy and most reliable results was selected as the best model for this task.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: 
2. Navigate to the specific task folder.
3. Review the models and their evaluations to understand the selection process.
4. Use the best model for further predictions or integrate it into your applications.
